## Introduction

The Effective Engineer, by Edmond Lau and published by The Effective Bookshelf, is a book focused mainly on leverage, and using your time as a developer to achieve the largest amount of that leverage possible. It covers quite a few techniques and practices that Edmond Lau discovered and improved upon at his time at companies such as Google and Quora. It has a website at http://www.effectiveengineer.com/ but actually I wouldn't really recommend that site as it looks very self-help-y and not really in the spirit of the actual advice of the book in my opinion.

It looks like this:

This blog post is part of my "Book Report" series, where while reading a book I've been recommended I'll take informal notes on each chapter and then type them up at the end as a blog post I can reread later as both a refresher and a place to note down my thoughts on the book in general.

## Chapter Breakdown

### Part 1 - Adopt the Right Mindsets

- Chapter 1 - Focus on High-Leverage Activities
This chapter introduces leverage as a concept and focuses on productivity from the standpoint of a whole business as opposed to a single person. I got the feeling it was mainly setup for the rest of the book, though it did have a few small points that resonated with me, such as how managers get more done since their tools are other developers.

- Chapter 2 - Optimize for Learning

Improving on learning ability and speed
Compound interest in comparison to compound learning
Time as a resource to manage
Some examples very product development and startup driven
Mentions joining a book club or discussion group
Mentions luck surface area but not by name
Being very responsible for your own learning

- Chapter 3 - Prioritize Regularly

Discerning higher leverage tasks and prioritising those above others
Single list of to-dos. Similar to gtdfh. Difficult to implement when calendars also a thing.
Break everything into lists of tasks and write down everything that needs doing
If then plans, reducing procrastination
Pomodoro for tracking as well as time management

### Part 2 - Execute, Execute, Execute

- Chapter 4 - Invest in Iteration Speed
focusing on iteration and shortening each iteration, whether deploy or debug loop
identify bottlenecks that take the most time, and reduce/eliminate them
time spent improving and automating is never wasted
try to quantify and measure time to identify possible optimisations
plan ahead in terms of external dependencies

- Chapter 5 - Measure What You Want to Improve
use metrics as much as possible for improvement
"is there some way to measure what I'm doing currently?"
using the correct metric for the job
visualising these metrics is also really neat
hoover up as much data as possible

- Chapter 6 - Validate Your Ideas Early and Often
shorter iterations allow for quicker feedback
chapter is very very startup focused
A/B testing is good... if you're in a startup
chapter might have been better in a book called "the effective startup founder"
small commits often, small pull requests often
feedback loops are really important

- Chapter 7 - Improve Your Project Estimation Skills
an estimate is different from a target, but a good estimate should be a target
estimates should be as granular as possible - anything over 2 days should be broken down further
get estimates reviewed by others
measure how long things take and compare against estimates to improve new estimates
well defined scope is important
front-load the hardest/scariest tasks
incremental rewrites are the only rewrites worth doing

### Part 3 - Build Long-Term Value

- Chapter 8 - Balance Quality With Pragmatism
code reviews good
writing good abstractions saves time
good API design is key
unit tests have a tipping point, where it becomes easier to write them, but getting to that point can be time-consuming
automated testing really shines when scaling systems
focus on the technical debt with the highest leverage, don't just try and erase all debt

- Chapter 9 - Minimize Operational Burden
minimise operational burden
simple technologies and older technologies have less risk, therefore less debt
systems shoudl fail fast and fail decisively
relentlessly automate
scripts should be idempotent, or at the very least transactional, this makes automation easier and cheaper
have a plan for when things go wrong

- Chapter 10 - Invest in Your Team's Growth
more manager focused chapter - hiring good etc
share ownership
review code
document things others will work on
reviewing past projects is generally a good idea
