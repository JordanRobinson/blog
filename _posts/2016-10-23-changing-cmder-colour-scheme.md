If you're confined to Windows and haven't tried out both [Cmder](http://cmder.net/) and [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/install_guide) then you're really missing out. It's about as close to a solid Linux terminal as you could hope for, with only a very small amount of features not yet available.

Cmder itself functions as a nice terminal wrapper, providing all kinds of nice little tweaks, profiles and shortcuts. One of these features that I only discovered recently is that you can change the colour scheme directly from the settings of the app.

This, combined with a nice little bash script found [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/27314/script-to-display-all-terminal-colors) that lists out all the different colours so you can test it, makes for a nice little light show:

Sorry if you were expecting an in-depth post about how Bash on Windows works, or the internals of Cmder, this one's just an excuse to make a pretty gif.
